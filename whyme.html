        Hello everyone, I'm hoping to join the Founders & Coders programme. Here
        is a little more about me.

        My interest in programming started in university, but I began actively
        learning the fundamentals of web development last year. I enjoy
        photography in my spare time, and I wanted to build a custom website to
        host my photographs, so I decided to learn how to code. I never thought
        I'd enjoy it so much. If you have time, you can check it out

          here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I started learning HTML5 and CSS3 using the online resources
        freeCodeCamp, Scrimba & Frontend Mentor. I am particularly interested in
        front-end development but keen to learn a variety of tech stacks. To
        date, I have completed more than 300 hours of freeCodeCamp's Responsive
        Web Design, Basic Javascript, ES6, Basic Data Structures, and Basic
        Algorithm Scripting. I'm still working on the rest of the Javascript
        modules, but I am currently focusing on the Founders and Coders
        application process. As well as completing hundreds of hours of
        self-study, I also attend weekly coding meet-ups at Codebar. Codebar's a
        charity that enables minority groups to learn coding in a safe space.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I learnt about Founders and Coders through a coder and friend who
        recommended the programme to me as it resonates with my values of making
        the tech industry a more inclusive and diverse place. I want to join
        this course to take me from a hobbyist website maker to a professional
        programmer. The opportunity to learn in a safe environment will help
        everyone reach their goals. After several months of self-studying, this
        programme is the next step in helping me join the world of tech and
        reach my goal of working in the industry.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I believe I am right for the Founders and Coders programme because the
        hundreds of hours of consistent effort to learn to code independently
        show my dedication to achieving my goal of becoming a full-time
        developer. Thanks for your time. Click here to see my
