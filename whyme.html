      <h1>Why Me?</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        Hi again, I'm really looking forward to joining the Founders & Coders
        programme. Here is a little more about me.
      </p>
      <img class="Img-Joe" src="Images/me1.jpeg" alt="" />

      <p>
        My interest in programming started in university, but I began actively
        working towards it a few months ago when I decided to build a custom
        website & for my photographs. You can check it out
        <a
          class="text-design-link"
          href="https://joe-lindie.github.io/Bindus-Photography/"
          target="_blank"
        >
          here.</a
        >
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I started learning HTML5 and CSS3 using the online resources Free Code
        Camp, Scrimba & Frontend Mentor. I am particularly interested in
        front-end development but keen to learn a variety of tech stacks. To
        date, I have completed the first 300 hours of Free Code Camp's
        responsive web design, basic Javascript, ES6, Basic Data Structures, and
        basic algorithm scripting. I'm still working on the rest of the
        Javascript module, and I will complete it in the next few weeks. I have
        also joined Codebar and attended several coding meet-ups.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I want to join the Founders and Coders to take me from a hobbyist
        website maker to a professional programmer. After three months of
        self-studying, the Founders and Coders programme is the next step in
        helping me join the world of tech and reach my goal of working in the
        industry.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I believe I am right for the Founders and Coders programme because the
        hundreds of hours of consistent effort to learn to code independently
        show my dedication to achieving my goal of becoming a full-time
        developer.
