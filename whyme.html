      <h1>Why Me?</h1>
      <h2>
        Hello everyone, I'm looking forward to joining the Founders & Coders
        programme. Here is a little more about me.
      </h2>

        My interest in programming started in university, but I began actively
        working towards it a few months ago. I enjoy photography in my spare
        time, and I decided to build a custom website for my photographs. If you
        have time, you can check it out

        I started learning HTML5 and CSS3 using the online resources
        freeCodeCamp, Scrimba & Frontend Mentor. I am particularly interested in
        front-end development but keen to learn a variety of tech stacks. To
        date, I have completed more than 300 hours of freeCodeCamp's Responsive
        Web Design, Basic Javascript, ES6, Basic Data Structures, and Basic
        Algorithm Scripting. I'm still working on the rest of the Javascript
        modules, but I am currently focusing on the Founders and Coders
        application process. As well as hundreds of hours of self-study, I also
        attend weekly coding meet-ups at Codebar, a charity that enables
        minority groups to learn coding in a safe space.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I recently met a coder who has now become a friend. They introduced me
        to the Founders and Coders programme. I want to join this course to take
        me from a hobbyist website maker to a professional programmer. I was
        drawn to Founders and Coders because you want to make the tech industry
        more diverse and inclusive for everyone. The opportunity to learn in a
        safe environment will help everyone reach their goals. After several
        months of self-studying, this programme is the next step in helping me
        join the world of tech and reach my goal of working in the industry.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I believe I am right for the Founders and Coders programme because the
        hundreds of hours of consistent effort to learn to code independently
        show my dedication to achieving my goal of becoming a full-time
        developer. Thanks for your time. Click here to see my
        <a class="text-design-link" href="myprojects.html"> projects page</a>
        and find out what I have done throughout the application process.
